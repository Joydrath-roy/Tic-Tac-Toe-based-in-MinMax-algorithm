Summary : We want to play a tic tac toe game manually. Then must be a
two-player move on the grid. For each move, we have to place it by
ourselves. In this project, I have done the computer as an opponent player.
So we have needed an AI move for the computer. Thatâ€™s why I use the
MinMax algorithm to ensure the best move for the computer. I use XML to
create a grid on the gameboard.
Implementation : MinMax algorithm,Java,XML,Android Studio.
